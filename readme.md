# Model to Recognize Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana Characters.

## TO DO:
Train on more slanted / warped images. Some of the bad classifications come from the really messed up images; we can just make more testing examples.

Will be prettier soon.

To be used in future pdf -> text pipeline.

### Output example
- Classification of 100 images from the test set. 
- The predictions (in read) are superimposed on the input images.
