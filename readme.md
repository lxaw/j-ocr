# Model to Recognize Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana Characters.

## Idea:
- Need something to recognize Kanji characters for future PDF reader.
- So I made a character recognizer for the Joyo kanji.

## TO DO:
- More transformations. Slant, blur, rotate, etc.
- More characters. Special characters like ・？＊, etc. Latin characters, in both horizontal and vertical. 

Will be prettier soon.

To be used in future pdf -> text pipeline.

### Output example
- Classification of 625 images from the test set. 
- The predictions (in read) are superimposed on the input images.
